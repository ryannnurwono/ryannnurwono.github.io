    <center><h3>Trying to protect his students' innocence <br>
      he told them the Ice Age was really just <br>
      the Chilly Age, a period of a million years <br>
      when everyone had to wear sweaters <br> <br></h3>
    <h3> And the Stone Age became the Gravel Age, <br>
      named after the long driveways of the time <br> <br></h3>
    <h3>The Spanish Inquisition was nothing more <br>
      than an outbreak of questions such as <br>
      "How far is it from here to Madrid?" <br>
      "What do you call the matador's hat?"<br> <br></h3>
    <h3> The War of the Roses took place in a garden, <br>
      and the Enola Gay dropped one tiny atom <br>
      on Japan. <br> <br></h3>
    <h3> The children would leave his classroom <br>
      for the playground to torment the weak <br>
      and the smart, <br>
      mussing up their hair and breaking their glasses, <br><br> </h3>
    <h3> while he gathered up his notes and walked home <br>
      past flower beds and white picket fences, <br>
      wondering if they would believe that soldiers <br>
      in the Boer War told long, rambling stories <br>
      designed to make the enemy nod off. <br><br></h3></center>
